1. Problem:

In 2017, Steam, the most popular platform for purchasing and playing computer games, generated over 4.5 Billion USD in revenue. In order to better understand the many factors that drive the changes in this industry, it is necessary to take a closer look at three key factors:
The producers and distributors of computer games
The games themselves
Those who purchase and play the games

2. Dataset:

Steam Store Games Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/nikdavis/steam-store-games
Dataset containing a variety of information about almost every computer game released on popular gaming platform Steam. This includes information such as review scores, average user play time, genres, tags indicating style of games, and number of people who own the title.

3. Proposed Solution and Real-world Application: 

We will use statistical methods including machine learning to find the correlation between different factors and sales. In order to better understand the production of games, games themselves, and the behavior of those who play them, we will analyze various topics, including:

Correlation between average play time and user scores
Comparison of free-to-play and paid video games
Analysis of genre popularity over time (measured with play time, scores, and purchases)
Comparison of different publishers, e.g. if choosing to publish certain genres over time affected success
Comparison of user activity across both publishers and developers, e.g. understand if certain developers make games that are meant to be played a lot etc.
Relationship between price and game popularity
Relationship between system requirements and game popularity

Further, we can try to predict the selling data and user rating based on genre, publisher, release date, etc.
